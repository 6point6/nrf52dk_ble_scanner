# Description
An example C++ application for the Nordic NRF52 Development Kit, built and deployed with Mbed Studio.

Requires the board to be running the [ARM DapLink bootloader](https://armmbed.github.io/DAPLink/?board=Nordic-nRF52-DK).

# Starting project
I started with the [mbed-os-example-bliky project](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-blinky/), which is one of the example projects in Mbed Studio.
