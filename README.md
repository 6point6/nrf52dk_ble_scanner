# Description
An example C++ application for the Nordic NRF52 Development Kit, built and deployed with Mbed Studio.

Uses the OS5 version of all the Mbed libraries. **Caution: Many of the example projects found on the Mbed pages use previous versions**. The [https://os.mbed.com/teams/mbed-os-examples/](up to date libraries are here).

Requires the board to be running the [ARM DapLink bootloader](https://armmbed.github.io/DAPLink/?board=Nordic-nRF52-DK).

# Starting project
I started with the [mbed-os-example-bliky project](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-blinky/), which is one of the example projects in Mbed Studio. Then copied [this main class](https://os.mbed.com/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-ble-EddystoneObserver//file/092c08942a29/source/main.cpp/).
